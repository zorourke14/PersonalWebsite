# 3D Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my 3D Developer Portfolio project! This portfolio showcases my skills in using modern technologies, deployed with enterprise-grade DevOps practices and cloud infrastructure. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **React.js**: For building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: For creating and rendering 3D graphics.
- **EmailJS**: For handling form submissions and sending emails.
- **Vite**: For a fast development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.

## üöÄ DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure

This portfolio demonstrates production-ready DevOps practices and cloud engineering skills:

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Complete infrastructure provisioning on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerized application with multi-service orchestration
- **Nginx**: Production reverse proxy with SSL termination and security configurations

### Cloud Architecture
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**: Cost-effective cloud deployment with VPC, security groups, and compute instances
- **Let's Encrypt**: Automated SSL certificate management with Certbot
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Security-first approach with TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption

### Production Features
- **Reverse Proxy Configuration**: Nginx handling SSL termination and load balancing capabilities
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose managing application and proxy services
- **Security Hardening**: Firewall rules, SSH key authentication, and minimal attack surface
- **Automated Deployments**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) ensuring reproducible environments

### Architecture Overview
