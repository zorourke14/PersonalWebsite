       I'm currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Finance at TCNJ, and I'm on track to graduate in Spring 2026. Over time, I've developed a strong interest in cloud technologies and DevOps.
       <br /><br />
       I'm especially drawn to cloud focused roles where I can work with tools. I actually built this personal website to both showcase my work and sharpen my DevOps skillsâ€”using Amazon EKS, Terraform, and Kubernetes to deploy and manage it. That hands-on experience gave me a deeper appreciation for scalable, cloud-native solutions.
       <br /><br />
       As President of HackTCNJ, I help lead the planning and execution of our annual hackathon, which brings together students passionate about building and learning. I'm also involved with DIGIT.ALL, a diversity and inclusion group on campus that creates spaces for tech-minded students from all backgrounds to connect and grow.
       <br /><br />
       Outside of tech, I like to unplug with hiking, fishing, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
       <br /><br />
       I'm excited about the chance to apply my cloud skills and wide range of interests to projects that make a real impact, and to collaborate with others who are just as passionate about tech as I am.
